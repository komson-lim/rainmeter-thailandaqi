# Thailand AQI Monitor

This is a rainmeter skin for monitoring AQI level in Thailand. If you don't have rainmeter installed, you can download rainmeter [here](https://www.rainmeter.net/). The data showing in the skin comes from [Thailand Pollution Control Department](http://air4thai.pcd.go.th/webV2/#).

## Configure
Copy ID number that will be displayed on the skin and paste it in Variables.inc in the @Resources folder. Be aware that some stations do not report all the values. You can check the raw data at [PCD Website](http://air4thai.pcd.go.th/webV2/#) first.
